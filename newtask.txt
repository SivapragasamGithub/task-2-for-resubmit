The Window: Your Portal to the Web Stage

Imagine a web browser window as a giant stage. This is where all the action happens – the text you read, the images you see, the videos you watch. The window object in JavaScript acts like the 
stage manager, controlling the overall browsing experience. It provides functionalities like:

Displaying webpages within the browser window
Managing browser history and bookmarks
Handling pop-up windows and alerts
Interacting with external devices like printers


The Document: The Play Itself

Now, let's shift focus to the content displayed on the stage – the webpage itself. This is where the document object comes in. It represents the HTML structure of the webpage, including 
elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Think of it as the play's script, containing all the information and instructions to build the webpage. 
The document object allows you to:

Access and manipulate the webpage's content (text, images, etc.)
Add, remove, or modify elements on the webpage
Respond to user interactions like clicks and form submissions
